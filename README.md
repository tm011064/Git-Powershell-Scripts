# Git-Powershell-Scripts

#### Usage

Add an environment path to the folder containing the script files. Then, you can call the `gs` cmdlet anywhere from your powershell shell.

You can choose the following options:

* [p] - this will push your current branch to the server
* [d] - this will open a prompt where you can select a local branch to delete
* [c] - create a new branch
